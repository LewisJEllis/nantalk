# NaN Talk
This is a short tech talk on NaN and its idiosyncrasies.

I first gave this talk at the February 2016 [SouthBayJS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/southbayjs/events/228239229/).

I used [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/) to make these slides. This repository contains the markdown and images used, and a PDF export for easy viewing.
