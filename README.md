# Idiosyncrasies of NaN Talk
This is a ~10-15 minute tech talk on what NaN is, where it appears, and what one should know about it, from the perspectives of JavaScript and the IEEE 754 spec.


I first gave a somewhat shorter version of this talk at the February 2016 [SouthBayJS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/southbayjs/events/228239229/). The slides are on Speaker Deck [here](https://speakerdeck.com/lewisjellis/the-idiosyncrasies-of-nan).


I gave this talk again at the May 2016 [WaffleJS Meetup](https://wafflejs.com/). The slides are on Speaker Deck [ here](https://speakerdeck.com/lewisjellis/idiosyncrasies-of-nan-v2), and there was also a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeM22aTO4Ks).


I made these slides with [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/). This repository contains the markdown and images used, and a PDF export for easy viewing.
